# Candidacy exams
Archive of questions asked by Dr. Bahlai for PhD Candidacy exams


## Student 1
*Student specializes in biogeochemistry, nutrient cycing, microbiology and functional ecology. Bahlai was the examiner in population and community ecology, and functional ecology. Student was assigned 6 papers and a textbook chapter on biodiversity and function*

### Written exam questions
1. Discuss the links between ecosystem service and ecosystem function. How does biodiversity influence service and function? Provide an illustrative example that distinguishes between these terms and related processes in an ecosystem that is familiar to you. Illustrate your answer with a conceptual diagram.

2. In your assigned readings, we’ve focused on the work of a single scientist, Dr. Elena Bennett, as a way to illustrate how a scientist’s research program can arise around a set of related questions. What is/are the core question(s) driving Dr. Bennett’s research program? For each of the six papers I assigned you, outline the paper’s main questions/objectives, its core findings or conclusions, and discuss how this fits into Dr. Bennett’s core research direction. Do you think Dr. Bennett’s core research program has changed over time? Why or why not?

3. Despite being one of the most prominent thinkers on the concepts of biodiversity drivers of ecosystem function and ecosystem service of our time, Dr. Elena Bennett of McGill University does not yet have a Wikipedia page. Given what you know now about the field and Dr. Bennett’s work, write a brief Wikipedia article. You can use this article, on prominent Kent State epidemiologist Tara Smith, as a template or as inspiration:

### Oral Exam Questions

1. Some authors treat ecosystem services and functions as very different things, and others use the terms almost interchanagbly. What do you think? As you did your readings, did you notice any patterns in how different authors used the terminology?

2. I thought it was interesting that you used sandstone filtering pollutants out of water as an example of a provisioning function. As an organismal person, I usually think of biotic examples first. So this got me thinking- are abiotic processes ecosystem functions, or would you classify them ab geochemical processes? or are they both? Is there a difference?

3. You mentioned that ecosystem functions 'maintain quality and viability ' of an ecosystem and I want to dig into that a bit- what do you mean by 'quality'? What about 'viability'? Are there processes and functions that can undermine quality and viability?

4. As a followup to my first question, can you think of other examples where differences in geography or dicipline have led scientists to come up with multiple definitions for the same terminology? What about multiple terms for very similar concepts?

5. What are the ecosystem functions and services that you study in your work? Are any of them synergistic? Are there tradeoffs between any of the ecosystem services within your study system?

6. Say you had unlimited resources- time, money, technology- how would that change your research plan? And once you're done your study, given all this knowledge and power- what would you manipulate in your system to restore it to its ideal function?
